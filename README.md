# bunline

bunline is a reimplementation of LINE Notify API (which has been [deprecated](https://notify-bot.line.me/closing-announce) and set to sunset on March 31, 2025) on top of LINEâ€™s Messaging API using the Bun JavaScript runtime. This project aims to provide a seamless transition for users from LINE Notify to the LINE Messaging API.

## Features

- Mimics the LINE Notify API endpoint for easy migration
- Supports sending text messages, images, and stickers
- Configurable through a JSON file
- Uses the LINE Messaging API as the backend

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime
- LINE Messaging API channel
- Channel Access Token
- User ID or Group ID for message recipients

For detailed instructions on obtaining the Channel Access Token and User/Group ID, refer to this [LINE Notify Migration Tips article](https://medium.com/linedevth/line-notify-migration-tips-0432e5f7af6e) (Thai language).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository

2. Create a `config.json` file in the project root with the following structure:

   ```json
   {
     "accessTokens": {
       "<your-access-token>": {
         "channelAccessToken": "<your-channel-access-token>",
         "to": "<user-id-or-group-id>"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Usage

Run the server:

```
bun run index.ts
```

The server will start on port 3717 by default. You can change the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

## Migration from LINE Notify

To migrate from LINE Notify to this solution:

1. Create a LINE Official Account and link it to the LINE Messaging API.
2. Generate a Channel Access Token.
3. Find the User ID or Group ID for message recipients. Refer to [LINE Notify Migration Tips article](https://medium.com/linedevth/line-notify-migration-tips-0432e5f7af6e) for more information.
4. Update your existing code to use the new endpoint.

## Environment Variables

- `PORT`: Set the server port (default: 3717)
- `CONFIG_PATH`: Set the path to the configuration file (default: config.json)
- `LINE_API_BASE`: Set the LINE API base URL (default: https://api.line.me)

## Limitations

- Image file uploads via the `imageFile` parameter are not supported
- This is a basic implementation and may not cover all LINE Notify features
